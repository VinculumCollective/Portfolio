    <h1>Vinculum Collective</h1>
  
    <p>We are Vinculum Collective, something that is meant to be a fun collaboration of two generative artists.</p>

    <p>We're not sure how much we will release, or how often, but our goal is to excite collectors and provide resources to other artists as much as we can.</p>
  
    <h2>Work</h2>
  
  <p>Our first project is releasing soon!</p>
  
  <h2>Essays</h2>
  
  <p>We're working on some cool stuff to post to fx(text).</p>
  
  <p>Kinda feels like we're working on too much at once, but we're having a blast. Keep up with any updates on Twitter at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/VinculumCollect">@VinculumCollect</a>.</p>
